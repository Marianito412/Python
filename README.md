# Python Projects

This is my Python repo. It contains some personal projects that I have build over the years

## Installation

I would go into it but there are so many projects that it would take too long, so here is general guide.

1. Read the imports on the top of the .py file that you would like to install.
2. Google "Python |NameOfLibrarie| install"
3. Open result from PyPi.org
4. copy and paste the pip command that is beneath the package title into a terminal

Note: if selenium is one of the used libraries you will have to download a web driver executable and possibly change some values in the code, just google "Install and setup selenium python".

## Contribution

I don't know why you would contribute to this mess of a repo, but I appreciate it. Pull requests are, of course, welcome. If you want to submit a whole project or a major overhaul, open an Issue to allow for conversation over the commit.
